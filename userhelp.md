# About this tool

This tool allows you to look up

* packages
* filenames (only with full path)
* commands
* provides

Most of the time the *autodetect* mode will do the right thing,
but if you need to, you can tell it for which kind you are looking.

Search for partial names is not yet implemented.

# Use case

I used it for [openSUSE bugzilla screening]
(https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&bug_status=REOPENED&chfieldfrom=40d&chfieldto=now&classification=openSUSE&email2=bnc-team-screening&emailassigned_to2=1&emailtype2=substring&list_id=2361161&order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_id%20DESC&query_format=advanced)

It might be useful to find a package in another distribution that might have a patch to fix your bug
